# Nature Gesture Interface

### Overview 
This project enables intuitive, real-time user interface (UI) control through hand gestures. By recognizing and predicting gestures, the system allows users to interact with digital environments in a natural and contact-free manner.


### Project Idea
The goal is to develop a gesture-based UI system that learns hand gestures and interprets them in real time, enabling seamless and intuitive interaction without physical input devices.

### Model Architecture
The system employs an artificial neural network (ANN) built on Transformer-based architecture to perform gesture recognition and prediction with high accuracy and responsiveness.
