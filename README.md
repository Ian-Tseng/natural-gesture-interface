# Gesture-based-user-interface




### Idea 
This project learns hand gestures and predicts them in real time to enable user interface (UI) control through intuitive, gesture-based interaction.


### Model architecture
The system uses an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture based on Transformer models for gesture recognition and prediction.
